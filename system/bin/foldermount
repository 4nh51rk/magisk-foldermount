# Magisk FolderMount v0.8
# (c) 2017 Codebucket
# Easily mount internal SD card folders to external SD folders. 
#
# Inspired by FolderMount created by madmack, unfortunately his app does not work with MagiskSU
#
# Internal SD card: /data/media/0/
# External SD card: /mnt/media_rw/XXXX-XXXX/
#
# Example: foldermount -b "WhatsApp" ".foldermount/WhatsApp"
# Use a dot at the begin to hide the folder from media scan ;)
